# NumberConversion
Funny school project on creating a program that converts Number into different formats.
(Literally my first webpage!)

[Link to the web app](https://relverie.github.io/NumberConversion/)

Now complete! The XML part drove me insane for a bit more than 2 weeks (javascript wasn't linked to the main page)
But now it is fully completed.
