progression:
user enters number, select number type
computer verifies number
if number type is correct:
    user enters desired conversion/binary addition
        if binary additon is desired:
            computer asks for second number
            computer verifies
                if number type is correct:

        else:
            computer converts number
            reset, if user desires
    number is returned
else:
return error

//verify denary (must be int, must be in range 0-255)
//verify hexadecimal (must only contain 2 characters, must only contain 0-9/A-F)
//verify binary (must be int, must only contain 0s/1s, must only contain 8 characters)

//convert denary into binary
//convert denary into hexadecimal
//add two denary numbers

//convert binary into denary
//convert hexadecimal into denary

//These three can be made by utilizing previous code
//convert binary into hexadecimal
//convert hexadecimal into binary
//add two binary numbers, provide results in binary and denary. (notify user if 8 bit overflow)
